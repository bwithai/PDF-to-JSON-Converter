(7) Developed means that an item, component, or process exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered \\"developed,\\" the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code. (8) Developed exclusively at private expense means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof. (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level. (ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense. (9) Developed exclusively with government funds means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense. (10) Developed with mixed funding means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract. (11) Form, fit, and function data means technical data that describes the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items. (12) Government purpose means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations, or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations.

The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if-(i) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is-- W900KK20C0031 Page 52 of 71 (A) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or (B) A release or disclosure to-(1) A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contract for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or (2) A foreign government, of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use of such databy the foreign government is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational purposes; (ii) The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and (iii) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use. (15) Technical data means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation). The term does not include computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information. (16) Unlimited rights means rights to use, modify, reproduce, perform, display, release, or disclose technical data in whole or in part, in any manner, and for any purpose whatsoever, and to have or authorize others to do so.

The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor\'s assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402. (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all technical data that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. Reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions. (2) Government purpose rights markings. Data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government purpose rights shall be marked as follows: Government Purpose Rights Contract No. ______________________________________________________________ Contractor Name ____________________________________________________________ Contractor Address ________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________________ Expiration Date ____________________________________________________________ The Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items clause contained in the above identified contract.

(i) Data in which the Government\'s rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend: Special License Rights The Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these data are restricted by Contract No. ________ (Insert contract number) ________, License No. ________ (Insert license identifier) ________. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. (End of legend) (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of this clause). (5) Pre-existing data markings. If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data deliverable under this contract, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed. (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliersthat will deliver technical data with other than unlimited rights, shall-(1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data delivered under this contract. (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings. (1) Unjustified technical data markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor\'s expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the procedures in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified. W900KK20C0031 Page 58 of 71 (2) Nonconforming technical data markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such marking within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor\'s expense, remove or correct any nonconforming marking. (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent. (j) Limitation on charges for rights in technical data. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including, but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data to be delivered under this contract when-(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data; or (ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions. (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause-(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier technical data, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data will be delivered. (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) The Contractor shall ensure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes of paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected. (2) Whenever any technical data for noncommercial items, or for commercial items developed in any part at Government expense, is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, including subcontracts or other contractual instruments for commercial items, and requireits subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. This clause will govern the technical data pertaining to noncommercial items or to any portion of a commercial item that was developed in any part at Government expense, and the clause at 252.227-7015 will govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government\'s, the Contractor\'s, or a higher-tier subcontractor\'s or supplier\'s rights in a subcontractor\'s or supplier\'s technical data. (3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher-tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. (4) The Contractor and higher-tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data from their subcontractors or suppliers. (5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the Government.

(d) Third party copyrighted computer software or computer software documentation. The Contractor shall not, without the written approval of the Contracting Officer, incorporate any copyrighted computer software or computer software documentation in the software or documentation to be delivered under this contract unless the Contractor is the copyright owner or has obtained for the Government the license rights necessary to perfect a license or licenses in the deliverable software or documentation of the appropriate scope set forth in paragraph (b) of this clause, and prior to delivery of such-(1) Computer software, has provided a statement of the license rights obtained in a form acceptable to the Contracting Officer; or (2) Computer software documentation, has affixed to the transmittal document a statement of the license rights obtained. (e) Identification and delivery of computer software and computer software documentation to be furnished with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure. (1) This paragraph does not apply to restrictions based solely on copyright. (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this clause, computer software that the Contractor asserts should be furnished to the Government with restrictions on use, release, or disclosure is identified in an attachment to this contract (the Attachment). The Contractor shall not deliver any software with restrictive markings unless the software is listed on the Attachment. (3) In addition to the assertions made in the Attachment, other assertions may be identified after award when based on new information or inadvertent omissions unless the inadvertent omissions would have materially affected the source selection decision. Such identification and assertion shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer as soon as practicable prior to the scheduled data for delivery of the software, in the following format, and signed by an official authorized to contractually obligate the Contractor: Identification and Assertion of Restrictions on the Government\'s Use, Release, or Disclosure of Computer Software. The Contractor asserts for itself, or the persons identified below, that the Government\'s rights to use, release, or disclose the following computer software should be restricted: Computer Software to be FurBasis for nished With Restrictions * Assertion ** Asserted Rights Category *** Name of Person Asserting Restrictions **** ______________________ _____________ _________________ ______ * Generally, development at private expense, either exclusively or partially, is the only basis for asserting restrictions on the Government\'s rights to use, release, or disclose computer software. ** Indicate whether development was exclusively or partially at private expense.

W900KK20C0031 Page 65 of 71 Date Printed Name and Title Signature End of identification and assertion) (4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor\'s assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor\'s assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software clause of this contract. (f) Marking requirements. The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software by marking the deliverable software or documentation subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract; the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402. (1) General marking instructions. The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmitted document or software storage container and each page, or portions thereof, of printed material containing computer software for which restrictions are asserted. Computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer\'s written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of computer software or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions. (2) Government purpose rights markings. Computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as follows: GOVERNMENT PURPOSE RIGHTS Contract No. Contractor Name Contractor Address Expiration Date The Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(2) of the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of the software or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. (End of legend) W900KK20C0031 Page 66 of 71 (3) Restricted rights markings. Software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with restricted rights shall be marked with the following legend: RESTRICTED RIGHTS Contract No. Contractor Name Contractor Address The Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (b)(3) of the Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such software must promptly notify the above named Contractor. (End of legend) (4) Special license rights markings. (i) Computer software or computer documentation in which the Government\'s rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked with the following legend: SPECIAL LICENSE RIGHTS The Government\'s rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by Contract No. (Insert contract number), License No. (Insert license identifier) Any reproduction of computer software, computer software documentation, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. (End of legend) (ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(5) of this clause). (5) Pre-existing markings. If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government\'s rights to use, modify, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software or computer software documentation and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such software or documentation with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the software qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed. (g) Contractor procedures and records. Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver computer software or computer software documentation with other than unlimited rights, shall-(1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and (2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on computer software or computer software documentation delivered under this contract. (h) Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings. (1) Unjustified computer software or computer software documentation markings. The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on computer software or computer software documentation furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software and the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning W900KK20C0031 Page 67 of 71 inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor\'s expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified. (2) Nonconforming computer software or computer software documentation markings. A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Asserted Restrictions--Computer Software or the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (60) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor\'s expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings. (i) Relation to patents. Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent. (j) Limitation on charges for rights in computer software or computer software documentation. (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in computer software or computer software documentation to be delivered under this contract when-(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the software or documentation; or (ii) The software or documentation are available to the public without restrictions. (2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause-(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor or supplier computer software or computer software documentation, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and (ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the software or documentation will be delivered. (k) Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers. (1) Whenever any noncommercial computer software or computer software documentation is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in its subcontracts or other contractual instruments, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government\'s, the Contractor\'s, or a higher tier subcontractor\'s or supplier\'s rights in a subcontractor\'s or supplier\'s computer software or computer software documentation. (2) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in computer software or computer software documentation from their subcontractors or suppliers. (3) The Contractor shall ensure that subcontractor or supplier rights are recognized and protected in the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause. (4) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in computer software or computer software documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government. (End of clause) W900KK20C0031 Page 68 of 71 252.232-7007 LIMITATION OF GOVERNMENT\'S OBLIGATION (APR 2014) (a) Contract line item(s) 0002, 0003, 0004, 0005, 0006, 0008, 0009, 0010 are incrementally funded. For this/these item(s), the sum of $4,601,798.99 of the total price is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. An allotment schedule is set forth in paragraph (j) of this clause. (b) For items(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government\'s convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on those item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated in any event to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for those item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled \\"TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT.\\" As used in this clause, the total amount payable by the Government in the event of termination of applicable contract line item(s) for convenience includes costs, profit and estimated termination settlement costs for those item(s). (c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least ninety days prior to the date when, in the Contractor\'s best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the applicable item(s). The notification will state (1) the estimated date when that point will be reached and (2) an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance of applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds identified in paragraph (j) of this clause, or to a mutually agreed upon substitute date. The notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds that will be required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this clause, for subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (j) of this clause, or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor\'s notification, or by an agreed substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \\"TERMINATION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT\\". (d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the parties will agree as to the period of contract performance which will be covered by the funds. The provisions of paragraph (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly. (e) If, solely by reason of failure of the Government to allot additional funds, by the dates indicated below, in amounts sufficient for timely performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under this contract and if additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the price or prices (including appropriate target, billing, and ceiling prices where applicable) of the item(s), or in the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder will be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the clause entitled \\"disputes.\\" (f) The Government may at any time prior to termination allot additional funds for the performance of the contract line item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause. (g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled \\"DEFAULT.\\" The provisions of this clause are limited to work and allotment of funds for the contract line item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract if fully funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this clause. (h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to this contract pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled \\"TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT.\\" W900KK20C0031 Page 69 of 71 (i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342. (j) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract in accordance with the following schedule: As funding becomes available (End of clause) 252.251-7000 ORDERING FROM GOVERNMENT SUPPLY SOURCES (AUG 2012) (a) When placing orders under Federal Supply Schedules, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedules, or Enterprise Software Agreements, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable schedule or agreement and authorization. Include in each order: (1) A copy of the authorization (unless a copy was previously furnished to the Federal Supply Schedule, Personal Property Rehabilitation Price Schedule, or Enterprise Software Agreement contractor). (2) The following statement: Any price reductions negotiated as part of an Enterprise Software Agreement issued under a Federal Supply Schedule contract shall control. In the event of any other inconsistencies between an Enterprise Software Agreement, established as a Federal Supply Schedule blanket purchase agreement, and the Federal Supply Schedule contract, the latter shall govern. (3) The completed address(es) to which the Contractor\'s mail, freight, and billing documents are to be directed. (b) When placing orders under nonmandatory schedule contracts and requirements contracts, issued by the General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Information Resources Management, for automated data processing equipment, software and maintenance, communications equipment and supplies, and teleprocessing services, the Contractor shall follow the terms of the applicable contract and the procedures in paragraph (a) of this clause. (c) When placing orders for Government stock on a reimbursable basis, the Contractor shall-(1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer\'s authorization, using FEDSTRIP or MILSTRIP procedures, as appropriate; (2) Use only the GSA Form 1948-A, Retail Services Shopping Plate, when ordering from GSA Self-Service Stores; (3) Order only those items required in the performance of Government contracts; and (4) Pay invoices from Government supply sources promptly. For purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the date of a proper invoice (see also Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 251.105). For purchases made from DoD supply sources, this means within 30 days of the date of a proper invoice. The Contractor shall annotate each invoice with the date of receipt. The Contractor\'s failure to pay may also result in the DoD supply source refusing to honor the requisition (see DFARS 251.102(f)) or in the Contracting Officer terminating the Contractor\'s authorization to use DoD supply sources. In the event the Contracting Officer decides to terminate the authorization due to the Contractor\'s failure to pay in a timely manner, the Contracting Officer shall provide the Contractor with prompt written notice of the intent to terminate the authorization and the basis for such action. The Contractor shall have 10 days after receipt of the Government\'s notice in which to provide additional information as to why the authorization should not be terminated. The termination shall not provide the Contractor with an excusable delay for failure to perform or complete the contract in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the Contractor shall be solely responsible for any increased costs. W900KK20C0031 Page 70 of 71 (d) When placing orders for Government stock on a non-reimbursable basis, the Contractor shall\\u2014 (1) Comply with the requirements of the Contracting Officer\'s authorization; and (2) When using electronic transactions to submit requisitions on a non-reimbursable basis only, place orders by authorizing contract number using the Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) Supplement to Federal Implementation Convention 511R, Requisition; and acknowledge receipts by authorizing contract number using the DLMS Supplement 527R, Receipt, Inquiry, Response and Material Receipt Acknowledgement. (e) Only the Contractor may request authorization for subcontractor use of Government supply sources. The Contracting Officer will not grant authorizations for subcontractor use without approval of the Contractor. (f) Government invoices shall be submitted to the Contractor\'s billing address, and Contractor payments shall be sent to the Government remittance address specified below: Contractor\'s Billing Address [include point of contact and telephone number]: Government Remittance Address (include point of contact and telephone number ) (End of clause) : W900KK20C0031 Page 71 of 71 Section J - List of Documents, Exhibits and Other Attachments EXHIBITS AND ATTACHMENTS Item Description Exhibit A CDRLS A001 \\u2013 A021 Attachment 1 ARCENT TSS PWS Attachment 1(a) ARCENT TSS PWS Appendix A \\u2013 Government Furnished Property Attachment 1(b) ARCENT TSS PWS Appendix B \\u2013 UDAIRI RANGE COMPLEX Maintenance Responsibility Attachment 1(c) ARCENT TSS PWS Appendix C - ASG-KU Udairi Range Complex (URC) Policy and Procedures (PAP)-Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Attachment 1(d) ARCENT TSS PWS Appendix D \\u2013 TADSS Locations and Availability Attachment 1(e) Reserved Attachment 1(f) ARCENT TSS PWS Appendix F \\u2013 Program of Instructions Attachment 1(g) ARCENT TSS PWS Appendix G \\u2013 TADSS Tech Manuals Attachment 2 DD254 (DRAFT with solicitation, FINAL at award) Attachment 3 Procedures for Government Property Attachment 4 ARCENT_Labor Rates_Price Workbook Attachment 5 Small Business Participation Commitment Attachment 6 Property Management Plan Attachment 7 Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) ", "temperature": 0.0, "max_tokens": -25662, "top_p": 1, "frequency_penalty": 0, "presence_penalty": 0}' message='Post details'
